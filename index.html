    <h2>The location of Earth in Space</h2>
       
        <div id="earthlocationparagraph"><p>Earth is located is the <strong>solar system</strong>, where it, along with seven other planets, orbits a star known as the sun. Planets <em>orbit</em> stars due to being inside a star's 
        <strong>gravitational field</strong> which creates a pulling force whilst a sideways force is also acting on the star at every instant; this results in an orbital path around 
        the star. Earth is the third out of eight planet from the sun and takes 365.25 days to orbit it and 24 hours to rotate on its axis once, thus why 365 days is a year and 24 hours is a day.</p></div>

    <h2>What is Out There...</h2>
        <p>Outside of our solar system are other systems which all make up our Galaxy: <br><strong>The Milky Way</strong>. In our galaxy it is extimated that there are around <strong>100 billion</strong><br> stars each
         with their own encompassing planets and solar systems, meaning<br> that there are even more than 100 billion planets, with only 5000 that have been<br> discovered. Even though our solar system only contains 
         one star, The Sun, there<br> are many solar systems in our galaxy which contain multiple and can have up to<br> 7 stars. Furthermore, these stars can vary massively in size with our sun only<br> being an average 
         star in terms of its size, whilst the largest known star <br>(<em>Stephenson 2 DFK 1</em>) is 2150 times bigger than the sun with a radius of 1.5 <br>billion killometers: the sun's being only 696,340km.</p>

    <h3>More on stars: The life cycle</h3>
        <p>Along with animals and plants, stars also have a begining, a 'life', and an end. The formation and birth of a star starts off with the shrinking and the warming up of a nebula which then becomes a <strong>protostar</strong>,
        a very young star still gathering mass from the nebula. Eventually, the core of the star becomes hot enough for <strong>nuclear fusion</strong> to be able to take place meaning that energy is provided and synthesizes new nuclei,
        so heavier elements (up to iron) are produced starting from hydrogen through the <em>proton-proton chain</em> - a multistep process where six protons fuse together to produce a helium nucleus and two protons. This stage is called the
        <strong>main sequence</strong> stage of a star. <br><br>
    
        The size of a star decides its exact lifetime as very massive stars use up their fuel quickly whilst smaller stars use up their fuel at a slower rate, therefore smaller stars will shine for a lot longer than larger stars.  
        After a long period of time, the hydrogen used in nuclear fusion begins to deplete, bringing a star to the final phase of its lifetime. A star will expand and change to the colour of red, also cooling down to ultimately become a 
        <strong>red giant</strong> or <strong>red supergiant</strong>. Depending on its mass there are different outcomes for a stars end: an average star will become a red giant whilst a massive star will become a red supergiant.
        A red giant will release heat and pressure from its collapsed core which dissipate the outer layers of the star into space, phasing into a <strong>planetary nebula</strong>, and then into a <strong>white dwarf</strong> 
        ,and finally becoming a black dwarf (non-luminous). However, a red supergiant's end is far more intense as it explodes as a <strong>supernova</strong>, scattering the stars' inside materials across space, leaving behind a
        <strong>neutron star</strong> - a rapidly spinning star made mostly of neautrons with a diamter of only 13 mies, but with a mass 1.35 times the sun's. If the star is large enough, a <strong>black hole</strong>
        forms when it explodes. </p>
